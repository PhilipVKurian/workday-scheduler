Workday Scheduler
A Web application which serves the purpose of remining the user when certain calendar events are due.

## Installation

N/A

## Features
The script features the implementation of Dayjs to track calendar events and use css to add interactivity to the page(when certain rows are color coded to 
display their status). The day is displayed at the top of the page and the user can type calendar events in the textarea. Once the save button is clicked the 
users input is stored in local storage and will persist on page reload.
